# EOSC211_Lab11
This is a part of the labs in Earth and Ocean Science 211 course at UBC.<br>
Lab11 examines some salinity data from sections south-west of Vancouver Island. Ultimately, it attempts to answer the question: Is water more saline on the shelf at this time?<br><br>

The lab interpolates data along oceanographic sections to a common distance from the shelf edge. It interpolates the salinity-depth-distance data from each track onto depth profiles that are evenly spaced in distance from X = -20km to X = +40km in 0.5km increments.<br>

The lab also compares the mean profiles at a distance of 0 and 20km from the shelf edge to see if they are statistically different. The following graph shows the mean salinity and the standard deviation in salinity as a function of depth at each distance. The thick solid lines in the right subplot show the mean salinity (black = 0km salinity, red = 20km salinity), and the thin solid lines show the mean +/- standard deviation on either side of the thick lines.
